Quadtree Return Problem:

Sqlite: 
	if done for each row, performance suffers greatly

Context Manager:
	returns null when piped to a file
		-> will need to write a parser
			-> otherwise it is read as a string
			-> liststream separates every element including brackets

Alter Quadtree implementation:
	returning object -> Need a new function implementation
		-> will eventually need to be inserted into sqlite
	to Sqlite -> will need to hardcode and may be more work than help
		-> cuts to the chase
